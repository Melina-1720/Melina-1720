 The instrutions on making the project motion sensor LED light dart board for CS 207. This project was simple to make as you can see all you need is an Arduino and a breadboard and have 9 cords handy. First you will have to hook up you Arduino to your computer and put the code in (the code will be at the bottom of the page) then setup you Arduino as seen below.
